An easy guide with troubleshooting tips to:

* create a MySQL database container,
* create a WordPress web server container,
* connect them with a user-defined bridge network,

* attach a host folder to hold the WordPress installation.

There are Windows (.bat) and Mac/Linux versions of:

* create (.bat or .sh) – create the network, volume and containers.
* stop (.bat or .sh) – stop the containers temporarily.
* restart (.bat or .sh) – restart the stopped containers.
* purge (.bat or .sh) – tear down the network and containers again.
